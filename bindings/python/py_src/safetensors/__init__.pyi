# TODO: once we upgrade pyo3 to >= 0.28, replace `stub.py` with a dedicated
# `tools/stub-gen` binary using `pyo3-introspection`,
# mirroring how `huggingface/tokenizers` does it (see PR #1928).

    Constructed from Python as `TensorSpec(dtype, shape, data_ptr, data_len)`.
    The dtype string is validated at construction; an unknown dtype raises
    immediately rather than failing further inside the serializer.

    `shape` is the logical (header) shape — the number of elements along each
    axis as recorded in the safetensors header. For packed dtypes like
    `float4_e2m1fn_x2` (two F4 values per byte), callers may pass the storage
    shape reported by their framework (e.g. `torch.Size`); the constructor
    transparently doubles the last dimension so `spec.shape` always reflects
    the logical element count.

    underlying buffer stays alive for the duration of every `serialize` /
    `serialize_file` call that consumes this spec.
