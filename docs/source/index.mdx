# Safetensors

Safetensors is a new simple format for storing tensors safely (as opposed to pickle) and that is still fast (zero-copy). Safetensors is really [fast 🚀](./speed).

## Installation

with pip:
```
pip install safetensors
```

with conda:
```
conda install -c huggingface safetensors
```

## Load tensors

```python
from safetensors import safe_open

tensors = {}
with safe_open("model.safetensors", framework="pt", device=0) as f:
    for k in f.keys():
        tensors[k] = f.get_tensor(k)
```

Loading only part of the tensors (interesting when running on multiple GPU)

```python
from safetensors import safe_open

tensors = {}
with safe_open("model.safetensors", framework="pt", device=0) as f:
    tensor_slice = f.get_slice("embedding")
    vocab_size, hidden_dim = tensor_slice.get_shape()
    tensor = tensor_slice[:, :hidden_dim]
```

## Save tensors

```python
import torch
from safetensors.torch import save_file

tensors = {
    "embedding": torch.zeros((2, 2)),
    "attention": torch.zeros((2, 3))
}
save_file(tensors, "model.safetensors")
```
